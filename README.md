# CASE STUDY:Bellabeat Fitness Analysis

INTRODUCTION:
This case study is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

I assumed to work as a Junior Data Analyst in Bellabeat marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are using Bellabeat smart devices. I cleaned and analyzed the data using SQL and PowerBI for visualization.

The data is from kaggle FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users.
